-- ============================================================
-- wacrm — which schema releases are already applied?
--
-- There is no migration runner in this setup: the bundles under
-- docs/deploy/ are pasted into the Supabase SQL editor by hand, and
-- nothing records that they ran. So before a deploy the only honest
-- answer to "did I already apply that one?" comes from looking at the
-- schema itself.
--
-- Paste this into Supabase Cloud -> SQL Editor and run it. Every row
-- should read APPLIED before you redeploy the matching code.
--
-- Read-only: it inspects catalogs and changes nothing.
