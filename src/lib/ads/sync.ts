/**
 * Ads sync — pulls campaigns + daily spend from Meta and resolves the
 * ad ids captured by the WhatsApp webhook (migration 037) into the
 * campaign that paid for them.
 *
 * Three passes per `ad_accounts` row, in this order:
 *
 *   1. Campaigns  — upsert every ACTIVE/PAUSED campaign. Runs first
 *      because pass 3 needs a campaign row to attach a resolved ad to.
 *   2. Insights    — upsert daily spend/impressions/clicks for a
 *      trailing window. Re-covers the last few days on every run (not
 *      just "since last sync") because Meta revises a day's numbers
 *      for a short window after it ends; re-fetching is how those
 *      revisions reach us.
 *   3. Ad resolution — for every ad id on a contact that has no
 *      campaign yet, ask Meta what campaign it belongs to and backfill
 *      `contacts` and `attribution_events`. Capped per run: this is one
 *      Graph API call per ad, and a spike of new ads (a fresh campaign
 *      launch) should not turn one sync run into an unbounded loop
 *      against Meta's rate limits. Which ads are due — including how
 *      failures are retried and eventually abandoned — is decided by
 *      resolution-policy.ts.
 *
 * Idempotent throughout — `ad_campaigns` and `ad_metrics_daily` upsert
 * on their unique keys, so re-running for the same window overwrites
 * rather than duplicates.
 *
 * On clocks: no day is ever computed from the server's local time here.
 * See src/lib/ads/day-key.ts for the three timezones involved and which
 * one owns what.
